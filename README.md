# Avian Influenza Surveillance Dashboard
This application is an Avian Influenza Surveillance Dashboard created
using Python-Django backend and PostgreSQL database.
The frontend is developed using an open source bootstrap template for the app layout
and mapping libraries such as MapboxGL.js and Leaflet.js for the GIS functionalities.
